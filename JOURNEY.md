# The Ghost-Hand Journey

### Day 0: The Pivot
Initially, we considered a Health App. We realized it was a "trap"—legally complex and over-saturated. We pivoted to **Project Ghost-Hand** to solve a trillion-dollar problem: The Industrial Skills Gap.

### Day 1: Foundation
Today we successfully connected the "Brain" (Gemini) to the "Workstation." We verified that Gemini 1.5 Flash can not only identify industrial components but also provide spatial coordinates for AR overlays.
